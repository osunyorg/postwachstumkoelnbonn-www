    <p>  <br>Post-growth  (or degrowth) is a collection of movements and approaches that challenge the assumption that endless economic growth is necessary or desirable. Placing the pursuit of growth above well-being is seriously harming people and the planet. Whether this is due to the pursuit of profits, or to support high consumption lifestyles of wealthier people and regions (especially in the Global North), or just because we have become locked in to a certain way of doing things, it doesn't have to be this way. Another world is possible, where we aim to reduce inequality and improve well-being, as well as reversing environmental breakdown.  <br>   <br> The post-growth movement , with all its activists, researchers and practitioners, advocates for a complete shift in society to prioritise social and environmental well-being over corporate profits. This means moving away from a growth-based economy and transforming politics to ensure fairness, justice, and a good quality of life for everyone within the planet’s limits. <br>   <br> Post-growth examples  on a small scale already exist in many sectors, from repair cafés and community supported agriculture, to community owned buildings or energy. With our activities we would like to give more visibility to these initiatives. There are also many researchers and organisations in Germany and around the world that are designing and experimenting with fairer economic models, and developing post-growth ideas further for all different aspects of life, from housing, to food, transport, production and more. So that we can meet our needs without overexploitation. There are even city administrations, and national governments, that are attempting to put some of these ideas into practice. But we won't be able to change things at a larger scale unless many more people engage with these ideas and make them their own.
