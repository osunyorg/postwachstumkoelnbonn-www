    Reclaim the Economy workshops

  body: >-
    <p>The first of a series?  <br>What gives you hope for the future? Do you want to imagine an economy that puts people and planet first? We first trialled this workshop as part of the global "Reclaim the Economy" week, on 1st February 2026 at the </p>  <p>Kulturraum in Ehrenfeld. In small groups (one English, one German), we thought about what would make our society sustainable and socially just, and possible next steps towards that. No specialist prior knowledge necessary. We want to repeat this workshop, so get in touch if you would like it to happen in your area or your group. </p>
