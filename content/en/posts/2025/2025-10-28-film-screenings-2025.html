    <p>  <br>Together with the organisation Foyer Futur, we organised two degrowth film evenings in October 2025, in Nippes (KluG, Liebigstr. 255) and Ehrenfeld (Motoki, Stammstr. 32). The 25-minute film was followed by a discussion with the director. We are grateful for your donations which helped to cover expenses.   </p>
