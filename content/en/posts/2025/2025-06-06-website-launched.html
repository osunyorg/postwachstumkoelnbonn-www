    <p>  <br>What if we were all able to step back and think about what kind of society we really want... About what is most important to us, and how we would like to organise things based on these needs and values.  What if we found ways together to take more agency to shape our everyday lives, and the future?  Is an economic system driven by profit and competition really the best way, or are there other models out there that would give us less stressful and more fulfilling lives, that would be fairer to everyone, and not destroy the planet in the process?  And how can we take the next steps towards this? </p>
